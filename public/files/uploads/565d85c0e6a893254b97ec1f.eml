Hello there,=20

We appreciate your patience and understanding regarding the Elastic Compute=
 Cloud and VPC resources. We understand that navigating the specifications =
can be challenging, and we=E2=80=99re committed to assisting you.

I=E2=80=99d be happy to help you with a one-time exception billing adjustme=
nt related to Elastic Compute Cloud and VPC resources resources charged. To=
 proceed, we=E2=80=99ll need to complete a few steps for evaluation.

Firstly, we need to terminate the active resources for Amazon Elastic Compu=
te Cloud and VPC services. However, after reviewing our records, we can con=
firm that the resources associated with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and VP=
C have already been terminated on our end.

Secondly, we need to gather the following information. Please be as detaile=
d as possible; this will help us evaluate your case.

1. What is the root cause of the charges? Include specific resources, servi=
ces, Regions, and the start and end dates of the issue.
2. Provide us with a breakdown of the unintended charges for the affected m=
onths.
3. Is there a specific reason that is preventing the payment of the charges=
?
4. What preventative measures have been put in place to avoid a occurrence =
of the same issue? Here are some examples:
5. Do you agree to review the pricing structure for resources that you inte=
nd to use before launching them?

As part of the evaluation process, we kindly request you to implement a pre=
ventive measures to avoid similar situations in the future. The Preventive =
measures created by the resources such as CloudWatch billing alerts and ala=
rms, Budgets, and CloudTrail helps you manage the resources of your account=
. =20

e documentation links below:

g-costs.html

Please, let us know as soon as this step is complete, to proceed with the b=
illing adjustment. We'll be waiting for your newest correspondence to take =
action as soon as possible.

We value your feedback. Please share your experience by rating this and oth=
